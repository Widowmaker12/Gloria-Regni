Did you have a good christmas this year?
Was it so awesome so you just want to re-do it again and again and again?
If any of these descriptions fits in on you, I recommend trying out this mod!

But what is this mod then?
Well, this mod is a relatively small mod which creates a decision from which you and your Crusader Kings II character can experience the wonderful time that we often refer to as christmas. This mod will hopefully allow for a new and fresh roleplay experience were your character will mainly explore his/her belief in god but also interact with the other scheming nobles that are plentiful in the Crusader Kings II universe. This mod may also convert infidel guests to the one true faith - so be aware! If you are not christian avoid this celebration completely or try it out and "accidentaly" die with the help of some zealous christians...

Contains:
	- 1 decision which triggers the christmas events
	- 85 christmas related events (some of these events are parts of event chains)
	
Requirements:
	- computer
	- brain - a brain with the size of a goldfish will not do!
	- Crusader Kings II
	- Legacy of Rome DLC ( This DLC unlocks one event chain more)
	
Credits:
	- Me (StoneWolf)
	- Me
	- and ehhh.... Me!  ;)
