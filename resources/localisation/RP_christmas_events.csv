RP_christmas.77.option2;No, God would never support such wickedness!;;;;;;;;;x
RP_christmas.78.desc;You can not bare staying in that room anymore. How they deliberately avoid eye contact is irritating but it is their constant whispering that is the worst. There are few parts of the castle that is not completely occupied by them but you think that you have found a place without them. The long outer wall is almost completely empty which makes it the perfect place for those who want to keep themselves to themselves. While casually starring at the inner tower you suddenly feel a strong push from behind making you wobble intensely until you suddenly come crashing down on to the small piece of bare grass that is just below. It is a long fall, and you do not survive it.;;;;;;;;;x
RP_christmas.78.option1;NOOOOOOO!!! *crack*;;;;;;;;;x
